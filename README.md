Stuff we need to play around with the transcription:
1. youtube-dl - A python library to download youtube videos
2. click - a python library
3. ffmpeg - an open source software for handling multimedia files

Go to https://ffbinaries.com/downloads and download the binaries ffmpeg, ffprobe, and ffplay. Unzip them and put them into a folder and put it in the same directory as your project.

4. Assembly AI API key  
5. There are separate functions for downloading, uploading, etc. but to just transcribe a video from link, type in terminal - python cli.py transcribe-from-link <link>
